/* Banking contract
When a Banking object is created it starts with a balance of 1000.
Fuctions of the contract are:
	- Deposit a specified amount to the specified account.
	- Get balance of account.
	- Withdraws a specified amount from an account if it contains the amount.
	- Transfer amount from one account to another.
	- Converts balance using ConvertLib.sol
